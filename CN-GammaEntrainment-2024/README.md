# CN-GammaEntrainment

This project is T. Edwald's contribution, of a notebook + presentation to describe a small experiment
which tested the ability to 'entrain' or induce Gamma waves in his own brain, by playing a 40 Hz sound 
in the environment.

The sound was generated by an APP on an iPhone, which was placed a few metres away from the listener
(to reduce EM interference on the measurement), and played through the normal iPhone speakers.
The effect on the brain was measured by EEG, using only a few electrodes.

Post-processing of the raw data was done with the attached python notebook.
